# Notes
notes: |
  - This VM is hosted on university infrastructure
  - GPU time-slicing allows 10 concurrent pods to share GPU
  - All Phase 1 experiments (14 total) ran on this configuration
  - This config will be used as conditioning input during model training
  - Model can later generate traces for different VM configs (e.g., AWS/Azure instances)
